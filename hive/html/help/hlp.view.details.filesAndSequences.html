<description>The <span class="pagetext">details</span> visualization tab allows a user to view and in some cases edit metadata associated with the selected file. This is one example of the <a href="hlp.view.controlList.html">control list</a> model is used throughout HIVE which integrates a set of controls with a list of definable, content-specific fields, allowing the user to describe associated data in great detail.<br></br>

Important: Any sequences loaded into HIVE will be added to the <span class="pagetext">sequences</span> repository by default. To define a sequence as a genome, you must open the <span class="pagetext">details</span> and add a <span class="pagetext">Category</span> by entering "Genomic" in the text field. A green check mark will appear, click it. This sequence will now appear in the <span class="pagetext">genomes</span> list once the page is refreshed.<br></br>

The <span class="pagetext">Taxonomy List</span> category allows the user to enter or modify associated <span class="pagetext">Taxonomy ID(s)</span> for the selected file. <span class="pagetext">Subsets</span> allows the user to define subsets of data by <span class="pagetext">Count</span> and <span class="pagetext">Type</span>. The user may also modify fields to link databases, provide a title, flag what has been modified, and provide a description for the selected file. Furthermore, the user may change the current values for Name and Path.<br></br>

Defining field statistics/properties which may not be changed include the compressed size, the number of associated records, the date and time of creation, the source from which the file was retrieved and the full size of the data.
