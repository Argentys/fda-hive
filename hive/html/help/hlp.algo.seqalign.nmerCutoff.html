<title>N-mer cutoff</title>
<definition>Select threshold length for N-mers</definition>
<description>The probability of occurrence of a N-mer is calculated based on the size of the genome.  Some N-mers are repeated much more than expected based on this calculation.  The <span class="pagetext">N-mer cutoff</span> eliminates those N-mers which are repeated a greater number of times than the expected occurrence.</description>
