<description>
Whole genome sequencing refers to the process used to determine the entire DNA content of an organism's genome in a single experiment. This process not only captures
 nuclear (chromosomal) DNA sequences, but also mitochondrial and/or chloroplast sequences when available. Due to the extensive size and complexity of this data, a
 large amount of computing power and storage capacity are needed to analyze WGS data.
