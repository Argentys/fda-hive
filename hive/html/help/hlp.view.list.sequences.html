<title>Sequences visual data container</title>
<definition>List sequences available to user</definition>
<description>The <span class="pagetext">sequences</span> tab is one instance of a <a href="hlp.view.dataContainer.html">data container</a> which provides an organized visualization
of data through the combined use of toolbar controls and content-specific tables.<br></br>

The sequence-specific layout provides information about each sequence in the user's space. Sequences can be made available by <a href="hlp.tool.dmDownloader.html">uploading or retrieving</a> the sequences from local computers or publicly available databases. Other users may also set permission controls so that data is shared among users, and in some cases HIVE may directly provide access to publicly available data.<br></br>

The sequences table contains five columns:<br></br>
1. A checkbox which, upon selection, provides the user additional options including <a href="hlp.tool.Hexagon.html">aligning the sequence(s) with the HIVE Hexagon tool</a>, downloading the sequence(s) to the local computer, deleting the sequence(s) from the list, editing certain rewritable metadata attributes (also accessible from the <a href="hlp.view.details.filesAndSequences.html">details</a> tab in the adjacent viewer), and setting the <a href="hlp.obj.sharing.html">permissions</a> associated with that data<br></br>
2. A HIVE-assigned unique identification number<br></br>
3. A name for the sequence, the default for which is the file name from which the sequence information was retrieved. (This information can be changed via the metadata icon in the <a href="hlp.view.dataContainer.html">toolbar</a> or in the adjacent <a href="hlp.view.details.filesAndSequences.html">details</a> tab)<br></br>
4. The number of records contained by that sequence file - for example, files generated by next-gen experiments should have multiple sequence reads associated with one file<br></br>
5. The size of the file<br></br>

The view can alternately be represented as a hierarchy which clusters sequences first by protocol (http, ftp, etc), then by a path identifier, and then file name. Selection of checkboxes next to each hierarchical entity allows the user to <a href="hlp.tool.Hexagon.html">align</a>, delete, <a href="hlp.obj.sharing.html">share</a> and <a href="hlp.view.details.filesAndSequences.html">edit</a> the selected sequence, just as the list allows. The user may navigate between list and hierarchy views by clicking the <img border="0" src="img/list.gif" width="12"/> <span class="pagetext">list</span> icon and <img border="0" src="img/tree.gif" width="12"/> <span class="pagetext">hierarchy</span> icons in the lower left of the box, respectively.
