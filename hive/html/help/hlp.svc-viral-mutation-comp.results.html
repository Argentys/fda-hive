<description>
The default view of the Viral Mutation Comparator results is the Result Table which reports the observed number 
and frequency of mutations across sources with respect to the position of the mutated residue in the reference protein. 
From this result view, you can further augment the table by selecting the <img src="img/upload.gif" width=15> Load New 
Data option and specifying the appropriate criteria. You can filter the table according to its 
<img src="img/database.gif" width=15> Data Source or add a <img src="img/plus.gif" width=15> new column to the summary 
table. You can also conduct additional analysis on the table by designating the x and y axes of <img src="img/pie.gif" width=15> 
graphs, or perform a number of transformations or statistical analyses by selecting the appropriate option from the
<img src="img/graph.gif" width=15> Analysis menu. Results can also be <img src="img/save.gif" width=15> downloaded
in csv format for additional external analysis.<br/> 
<br/>
Three additional result views are available:
<ul "style=padding-left:4%">
<li><span class='pn'>Intermediate Table</span> - This table is the whole table combining HIVE-heptagon and externally 
generated mutation data tables following the format as specified in the<a href="hlp.svc-viral-mutation-comp.parameters.html">parameters</a>section.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>Pie Graph</span> - This pie chart shows the distribution of nucleotides across all sample data.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>Filtered Table</span> - This table shows only a portion of the data subject to a specified filter.</li>
</ul>
