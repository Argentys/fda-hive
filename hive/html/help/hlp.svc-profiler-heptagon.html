<title>HIVE-heptagon profiler</title>
<definition>Base and variant calling</definition>
<description>
The <span class='toolname'>HIVE-heptagon</span> profiler performs base and SNP-calling for a previously computed alignment and provides quality and noise assessment profiles.
Variant-calling is achieved by calculating the frequency of individual bases at specific positions and comparing those values to the base present at the corresponding position in
either a reference or consensus sequence. Post-alignment quality control procedures are based on positional base-frequency entropic information to help validate alignment results
 and distinguish computational artifacts from real biological variability.<br/>
<br/>
Graphical representation of genomic-proteomic mapping is also facilitated through the automatic retrieval of annotations and metadata associated with the input files upon entry
 into HIVE. Mapping of these annotations to the genomic position and superimposing the results on single graph enables clear visualization of SNP mutations which may
 affect protein structure.<br/>
<br/>
<span class='heading'>Basic Inputs and Parameters</span><br/>
The default input page for the SNP profiler displays identical information to the <a href="hlp.obj.svc-align-hexagon.info.html">alignment results</a> output summary with the most
frequently modified profiling parameters called out below. In this page, however, the <img src="img/list.gif" width=15> <a href="hlp.obj.svc-align-hexagon.tab-list.html">list</a> of
hits to references is interactive, enabling check box selection of the references to be profiled. Once desired references are selected, you may simply click the "Analyze" button to
proceed with default inputs. Additional basic parameters include the following:
<ul>
<li><span class='pn'>Name</span> - Provide a unique name to the profiler process for easy search and retrieval of results. A default name will be provided if nothing is specified</li>
<li><span class='pn'>Profile type</span> - Specify whether profiling is to be computed with respect to the reference sequence provided or the consensus of the reads. </li>
<li><span class='pn'>Minimal coverage allowed</span> - Specify the minimum coverage of alignment at a position such that any position with coverage less than the designated value
threshold will be ignored during the base-calling procedure.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>Alignments to use</span> - By default, the single alignment from which the profiler page was accessed will populate this field. Clicking the dropdown menu will
 open your user home directory from which you can select multiple alignments for profiling to the same reference set. Alignments can be removed from inputs by selecting the corresponding
 row and clicking the red <img src="img/recDelete.gif" width=15> icon to the right.</li>
 </ul>
 Note: all parameters have descriptions accessible in the interface by hovering the mouse over a topic.<br/>
