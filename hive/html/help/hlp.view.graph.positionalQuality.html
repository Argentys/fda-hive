<title>Query Sequence positional-quality chart</title>
<definition>View a graph showing the quality of each base at each position of the query sequence</definition>
<description>This tab is only present when an individual sequence (with green check mark icon) is selected from the <span class="pagetext">Query Sequences (reads)</span> menu.  Clicking this tab displays a graph with Position on the X axis and Quality on the Y axis.  All quality values are reported as <a href="hlp.obj.phred.html">Phred scores</a>.  The four colors denote the four bases A, T, C and G.  Hovering over any position will display a small pop-up window containing the exact position along the read (X value) and the corresponding quality scores of each base at that position.</description>
