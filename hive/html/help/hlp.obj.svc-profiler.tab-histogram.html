<description>The alignment-specific table has rows arranged as corresponding triplets, the top being the reference sequence, the middle displaying alignment and the bottom showing the query sequence.
 A pipe (|) symbol signifies a match at that nucleotide position whereas a space indicates a mismatch. The columns of the table are as follows:<br/>
<ol>
<li><span class='pn'>Start</span> lists the start position of the alignment for each sequence. The top row is the number assigned to the reference, the bottom row of the triplet is
the number assigned to the query.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>Alignment</span> displays the actual alignment in the triplet format discussed above.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>End</span> displays the end position of the alignment for each sequence. Again the top and bottom numbers report the positions of the reference and the query,
 respectively. The middle number is the length of the actual alignment reported.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>Sequence</span> lists names for each sequence as specified by ID lines of corresponding read and reference input files.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>Repeats</span> lists the number of repeats of that exact alignment (if applicable) instead of displaying them as multiple rows in the table.</li>
</ol>
