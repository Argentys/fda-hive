<title>Score Filter parameter</title>
<definition>Alignments with scores lower than the specified value will be excluded</definition>
<description>Each alignment produces a score based on matches, mismatches, insertions, deletions and gaps.  Usually, a higher score is correlated with a better alignment.  The <span class="pagetext">Score Filter</span> option allows the user to eliminate alignments with lower scores.  The default is set to “None” which means all alignments are reported and nothing is discarded.</description>
