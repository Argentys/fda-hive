<title>SNP Calls</title>
<definition>View a summary table of called SNPs</definition>
<description>This table summarizes the SNP call information displaying position, quality and count details for
those positions with a frequency of variation higher than the specified threshold. If annotation files have been supplied,
results can be filtered by one of the checking one of the following options in the Annotations menu in the toolbar:<br/>
<ul>
<li><span class='pn'>ORF</span> - If selected, the table will include only those SNPs annotated to occur within and open
reading frame.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>non-synonymous</span> - If selected, the table will include only those SNPs which result in altered
translation and are therefore non-synonymous.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>hide reference name</span> - The subject column will be hidden.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>show rsID</span> - The table will be reloaded with a new column to include the rsID of annotated SNPs from
dbSNP, if relevant.</li>
</ul>
The default SNP frequency threshold for display is 0.05, but this value is customizable.
