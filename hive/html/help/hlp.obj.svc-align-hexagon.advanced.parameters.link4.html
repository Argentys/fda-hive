HIVE alignments are highly customizable to meet 
the flexible demands of a variety of use-cases. 
The following provides instruction and discussion 
about advanced alignment parameters.

<span class='heading'>Advanced Parameters: Paired End Filters</span>:
<ul style="padding-left:4%">
Paired end filters are specifically designed for use on paired 
end reads sets. Normally, selecting any set of paired ends R1 and 
R2 as Sequence Read inputs in Hexagon does not tell Hexagon to 
acknowledge them as forward and reverse paired end reads. Rather, 
Hexagon treats them as two standard reads. However, checking any of 
the paired end filters will instruct Hexagon to recognize the reads 
as originating from two ends of one continuous sequence.
<br/><br/>
Selecting any one of these paired end filters will cause Hexagon to 
recognize the first half of the inputs in the Sequence Read field 
as reads in one direction and the second half of the inputs as reads 
going in the opposite direction. For instance, if you have 2 reads, R1 
and R2, entered in the Sequence Reads field, then they will be 
considered as a pair of two ends from one continuous sequence.
<br/><br/>
Likewise, if you have reads R1, R2, R3, and R4 entered in that order, 
Hexagon will consider R1 and R2 as reads in one direction, and it will 
consider R3 and R4 as reads in the reverse direction. This will occur 
even if reads R1 and R2 are in fact directionally opposite of each 
other. So, the order in which paired end reads are input into the 
Sequence Read field is important.

<dl>
<dt><span class='pn'>Filter pairs on different subjects</span></dt>
    <dd>
        Checking this parameter will filter out any alignments where 
        pairs were found on different subjects.
    </dd>
<br/>
<dt><span class='pn'>Filter pairs with wrong strandedness</span></dt>
    <dd>
        Checking this parameter will filter out alignments where 
        two reads of a paired end read are both forwards reads or 
        both reverse reads.
    </dd>
<br/>
<dt><span class='pn'>Filter unpaired alignments</span></dt>
    <dd>
        Checking this parameter will filter out alignments that 
        were found to contain only one side of a paired end 
        read aligning to the reference.
    </dd>
<br/>
<dt><span class='pn'>Length of the Fragment</span></dt>
    <dd>
        Here, enter the Min and Max fragment lengths of 
        the reads set so that paired ends that comprise 
        a segment outside of these ranges can be filtered 
        out as not being paired ends.
