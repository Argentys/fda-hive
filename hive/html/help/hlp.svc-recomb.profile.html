<title>Recombination discovery profile view</title> 
<definition>View results as positional coverage and mutations</definition>
<description>
The profile view has two graphs, similar to the results of the HIVE-heptagon variant caller output. The top graph shows the coverage 
of reads along the length of the selected reference(s), and the bottom shows the frequency of variations at each position.<br/>
<br/>
To select and view results for multiple references simultaneously, check the corresponding checkbox in the Recombination Algorithm 
Parameters section at the top of the page. If more than one reference is selected, the plots for all references will be superimposed 
on the same positional frame.
