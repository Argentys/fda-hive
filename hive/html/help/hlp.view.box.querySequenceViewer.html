<title>Query Sequence Information Viewer</title>
<definition>Browse multiple views of sequence information and quality assessment for the selected query</definition>
<description>This window displays the title and description of a query sequence.  When the user clicks on a blue folder in the the <span class="pagetext">Query Sequences (reads)</span> section, the title and description change to summarize the information contained in that folder.  When the user selects an individual sequence (with green check mark icon), the title and description change to describe the selected sequence.
Furthermore, selection of an individual sequence will populate the viewer with new tabs allowing for the visualization of various aspects of the sequence quality.  New tabs include <a href="hlp.view.sequence.reads.html">sequence</a>, <a href="hlp.view.graph.positionalQuality.html">positional-quality</a>, <a href="hlp.view.bar.baseCount.html">base-count</a>, <a href="hlp.view.bar.baseQuality.html">base-quality</a>, <a href="hlp.view.histogram.lengthHisto.html">length-histogram</a> and <a href="hlp.view.histogram.qualityHisto.html">quality-histogram</a>.</description>
