<title>All User-initiated Cloud Processes</title>
<definition>Visualization of algorithmic and data-loading cloud processes</definition>
<description>This page is an example of a <a href="hlp.view.dataContainer.html">data container</a> visualization which employs a toolbar to modify and organize a content-specific list.<br></br>

 The process-specific content is identical for the list of all processes, data loading processes and algorithmic processes. In fact, the data loading and algorithmic processes lists are just subsets of the all processes list, containing only those types of processes defined by their labels.<br></br>

 Each table contains six columns:<br></br>
 1. A checkbox which, when selected, allows the user to download the file to local computer, delete the process record from the list or edit the content of the process record<br></br>
 2. A HIVE-assigned unique identifier<br></br>
 3. A name for the process, the default for which is the file name inovled. (This information can be changed via the metadata icon in the toolbar or in the adjacent details tab)<br></br>
 4. A name for the task, defined by HIVE and the specific process initiated<br></br>
 5. The current status of the project<br></br>
 6. The progress to completion expressed as a percentage
