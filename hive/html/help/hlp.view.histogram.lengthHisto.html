<title>Query Sequence Viewer – Length-histogram</title>
<definition>Describe the “length-histogram” tab and graph.</definition>
<description>This tab is only present when an individual sequence (with green check mark icon) is selected from the <span class="pagetext">Query Sequence (reads)</span> menu.  Clicking this tab displays a histogram with rectangles corresponding to the length of each read on the X axis and the quantity of reads of that length on the Y axis.  When the user hovers over a rectangle, a small pop-up window displays the exact count of reads for the selected length.</description>
