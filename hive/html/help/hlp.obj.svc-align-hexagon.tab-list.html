<title>Summarized list of hits in table format</title>
<definition>View summarized alignment information</definition>
<description>This is the default view of the alignment results. The table summary of the alignment data lists each reference segment with corresponding number (ID) and name (Reference).
 The Hits column displays the number of alignments of the query sequence to that reference segment and the Length column reports the length of the corresponding segment covered by the
 alignment.<br/>
 <br/>
For each analysis the first row is designated with the number 0 and the Reference label "Unaligned". These are the query sequences which did not align to any part of the selected reference
 genome. The number reported in the Hits column is abbreviated for spacing purposes, but hovering the mouse over the value will display the accurate count down to the ones digit.
