<definition>View the distribution of reads to your references</definition>
<description>The saturation view can help determine whether your samples were sequenced to a depth appropriate for discovery of all possible references. For example, if you have 
a single reference, the first read that maps to your reference will "saturate" your pool of references. However, if you are aligning to a database of genomes, it may take millions of reads to map 
before you have covered the majority of your reference set. This information allows the user to visualize the benefit of additional depth by showing the rate at which additional 
references are hit for a given number of considered reads. This information can be very helpful for experiments aimed at identification of potentially rare or low-abundant sequences.
