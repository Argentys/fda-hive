<definition>Choose whether to find optimal alignment by the Smith-Waterman algorithm or to simply search for identities</definition>
<description>This option allows the user to choose to find the optimal alignment using the <span class="pagetext">Smith-Waterman</span> algorithm or quickly look up highly scoring hits.  The Smith-Waterman algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that employs a substitution matrix to yield the highest scoring local alignment.  The time required by the algorithm to return the optimal alignment greatly increases with an increase in sequence length.  If the user is not interested in optimal alignments and merely wants to identify high scoring potential hits, the <span class="pagetext">Only Identities</span> option will produce results at a faster rate.</description>
