<title>Query Sequence base-count bar chart</title>
<definition>View the count of each base in the query sequence as a bar chart</definition>
<description>This tab is only present when an individual sequence (with green check mark icon) is selected from the <span class="pagetext">Query Sequences (reads)</span> menu.  Clicking on this tab will display a bar graph with bars for each nucleotide on the X axis and the count of the corresponding nucleotide on the Y axis.  When the user hovers over each bar, a small pop-up window shows the exact count of the selected nucleotide.</description>
