<definition>View mutation bias and stack for alignment</definition>
<description>This visualization has two components, the mutation bias graph and the stack. To view detailed information, a reference segment must first be
selected from the <a href="hlp.obj.svc-align-hexagon.tab-list.html">hits list</a> to the left by clicking the corresponding row.<br/>
<br/>
The stack displays essentially the same information as the alignment table in a different format, representing all matches as dots (.) and only displaying the actual
nucleotide of the read at positions where the read and reference do not match. The column headings provide the information for the reference, where as each subsequent row
contains the corresponding information for each read. Columns include:<br/>
<ol>
<li> The first column indicates the position of the left end of the reference frame. This can be changed by entering a different value in the "position" search box in the top right
corner of the stack tab. The number in successive rows indicates the corresponding positions of reads.</li>
<li>The nucleotide sequence displayed is the reference sequence at that position. Dots in in the corresponding rows indicate that the read matches the reference at a given position and
actual reported letters are the base called at that position of the read which does not match the reference.</li>
<li>The third column reports the end position of alignment with respect to the reference frame. Again, this can be changed by centering around a different position using the "position"
search box in the top right.</li>
<li>This column heading should report the name of the specific reference segment selected from the hits list on the left. Subsequent rows display the ID lines for the corresponding
aligned reads.</li>
<li>The <span class='pn'>Repeats</span> column lists the number of exact repeats of that read which were contained in the reads file.</li>
</ol>
