<title>Profile computation</title>
<definition>View profile of alignment across all references</definition>
<description>This tab is identical to the profile tab shown in the HIVE-heptagon profile results. The top graph
 shows forward and reverse coverage as a function of position on the reference genome (or consensus, depending
 on the user's selection), where coverage is the number of reads aligned to a specific position.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom graph shows variations from the reference (or consensus) sequence at a given position as colored peaks.  Each nucleotide is designated by a specific color.  Holding the mouse
 over a peak will display an information box containing the position in the sequence, the nucleotide variation and the percentage of that variation with respect to all reads at that
 position.<br/>
<br/>
You may also view the In-dels graph if insertions and deletions were searched for in your input paramters.
