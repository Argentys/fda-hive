<title>Open Reading Frame summary</title>
<definition>View called mutations with respect to annotated open reading frames</definition>
<description>This tab will display graphical representations of ORFs only if annotations have been supplied. The first graph will
show the position of significant SNPs according to the threshold set in the SNP calls tab plotted against their frequencies. The
second will show the position of all open reading frames annotated to occur along the length of the specified reference.
