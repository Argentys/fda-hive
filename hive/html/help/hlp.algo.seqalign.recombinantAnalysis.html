<definition>Analyze recombination between two reference genes hit in the alignment</definition>
<description> This section allows the user to perform recombinant analysis between any two of the reference genes listed in <span class="pagetext">pairs</span> tab on the left (corresponding to the genes in the reference genome).
The user must select exactly two of these genes by clicking the adjacent checkbox before running the recombinant computation or building a recombinant polyplot (sections to the right). </description>
