<description> The short reads are the output data from a sequence experiment you intend to align to a reference genome. Short reads can be selected for alignment from the table by checking one or many checkboxes to the left of the associated files. After each click the box will close. You may select multiple by either reopening the box and selecting another, or by holding the control key while checking multiple boxes.<br></br>

Once short read sequence(s) are selected, you will see the names of each file and the number of corresponding record(s) for each in the Short Reads input box.<br></br>

You may alternately create one hybrid query sequence from multiple files by clicking the <img border="0" src="img/hiveseq.gif" width="12"/> icon, which will redirect you to a new page. On this page, select your desired sequences to concatenate, click the <img border="0" src="img/plus.gif" width="12"/> icon to add the sequences to the composition space below. Enter a name in the 'new hiveseq name' field and click the <img border="0" src="img/hiveseq-save.gif" width="12"/> icon to save the new sequence. The new sequence will be available in the short reads list on your home page after the page is refreshed.<br></br>
