<title>Details for specific cloud process</title>
<definition>View metadata associated with specific record</definition>
<description>The process-specific details visualization tab allows a user to view metadata associated with the selected file. This is an example of the <a href="hlp.view.controlList.html">control list</a> model used throughout HIVE which integrates a set of controls with a list of definable, content-specific fields, allowing detailed description of associated data.<br></br>

No attributes for the process-specific details may be altered. Data-loading processes list attributes associated with process submission and completion, including source URL, date and time process was created, started and completed, the HIVE-assigned request ID, the ID title of the service requested, and the user-selected value of download concurrency. The details page for algorithmic processes contains most of the same information, but reports many more user-defined parameter values as the algorithms use more parameters.</description>
