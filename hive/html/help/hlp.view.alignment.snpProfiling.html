<description> This tab shows the alignments of the query sequence reads to the reference  genome.
<span class="pagetext">Subject</span> denotes the reference genome and <span class="pagetext">Query</span> the query sequences.  The number next to query or subject is the unique identifier for that read.  The next numbers constitute the positional range within the sequences.  <span class="pagetext">(+)</span> indicates an alignment in the forward direction, <span class="pagetext">(-)</span> in reverse.  An upper case letter in the alignment indicates a match and a pipe (|) will appear between sequences.  A lower case letter indicates a mismatch and a blank space will appear between sequences.  A - indicates a gap was inserted into the alignment.  It will appear both between the sequences and within the sequence in which the gap was inserted.
Each subject/query pair constitutes one read alignment, and is presented as one long line per set.  </description>
