<title>E-value filter</title>
<definition>Discar alignments with E-values greater than the specified threshold</definition>
<description>The E-value is the expected value of high scoring sequence pairs specified by a minimum score value of a local alignment (BLAST).  A lower E-value generally indicates a better alignment.  This filter discards alignments with an E-value higher than the designated filter.  If the user specifies “none” for this value all alignments satisfying the other criteria will be reported.</description>
