<span class="pagetext">Alignment Histogram</span> - will return a .csv file.  Table columns give information for length, read count and alignment count.
<span class="pagetext">Consensus Sequence</span>  - return a .fa file containing consensus sequence used in SNP analysis.
<span class="pagetext">Contigs and Gaps</span> - return a .csv file.  Table columns include the start and end positions, length, average coverage and whether or not there is coverage for each gap in the analysis.
<span class="pagetext">Alignments</span> - return a .txt file containing alignments.
<span class="pagetext">Match table</span> - return a .csv file containing information from the <a href=" hlp.view.table.matchTable.html">match table</a> tab.
