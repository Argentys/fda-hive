<description>The user home page houses all user-specific data. The left hand directory allows you to view, manage, organize, and selct
 your files and sequences. Selected folders/objects can be viewed and modified using the extended directory on the right. By default, all
 files uploaded by you will go directly to your Inbox. The All objects folder will contain all HIVE objects accessible to you, including
  both those you uploaded personally and those shared with you by other users. The HIVE Space folder is a virtual folder which allows
   you to create and impose your own organization of your user objects.
