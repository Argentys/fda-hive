<title>Text hierarchical clustering results</title>
<definition>The clustering engine's end output is a tree structure whose leaves are the input data. It is displayed graphically in the form of a phylogram.</definition>

        <p>This is a graphical view of the hierarchical clustering result. Input items (alignment profiling results) are represented as leaves of the tree, displayed as labeled circles. You can click on the leaf-circles to enable or disable the corresponding SNP frequency graph on the right.</p>
        <p>Phylogram branches can be collapsed or expanded by clicking on the inner nodes, represented as squares.</p>
        <p>The phylogram can be downloaded in SVG format by clicking on the link below it. Note that some web browsers (e.g. Google Chrome) may refuse to download the file until you click on "keep" or "allow". Others may open the SVG file inside the browser itself, and you will need to use <span class="nobr">Ctrl-S</span> or File&rarr;Save to save it.</p>
        <p>Below the phylogram, there are controls to change its shape (circular or rectangular) and the branch scale (choosing "none" makes the phylogram easier to interpret if some branches are much longer than others).</p>
