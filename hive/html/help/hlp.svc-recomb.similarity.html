<title>Recombination discovery similarity view</title> 
<definition>View results as representations of similarity across references</definition>
<description>
By default, your results will load in the similarity tab for the first reference in your input list. The top graph in the similarity 
view depicts the coverage of mapped reads at a given position along the selected reference weighted by the alignment score. The bottom 
graph shows the same values scaled to 100%. This scaling is important when multiple references are selected, as it allows visualization 
of the percent contribution of each reference to the coverage at a given position.<br/>
<br/> 
To select and view results for multiple references simultaneously, check the corresponding checkbox in the Recombination Algorithm 
Parameters section at the top of the page. If more than one reference is selected, the plots for all references will be superimposed 
on the same positional frame.
