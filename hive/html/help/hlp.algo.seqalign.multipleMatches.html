<title>Multiple matches</title>
<definition>Choose how to view and rank alignment results with multiple matching alignments</definition>
<description>The alignment results can be filtered by choosing one of three options.  The reported matches/alignments can be returned as either the <span class="pagetext">Best match</span> or <span class="pagetext">First match</span>, or as the list of <span class="pagetext">All matches</span>.  The <span class="pagetext">First match</span> option can be useful when the user is simply interested in finding the genome to which a query sequence belongs, whereas the <span class="pagetext">/Best match</span> option ranks alignments according to alignment scores.</description>
