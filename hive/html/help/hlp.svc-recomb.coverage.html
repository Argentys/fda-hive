<title>Recombination discovery coverage view</title> 
<definition>View results as representations of raw coverage across references</definition>
<description>
The coverage view has a similar presentation to that of the similarity view except the values represented are simply the total number 
of reads aligned to a given position (with no weighting imposed). The top graph, then, depicts the coverage of mapped reads at a position 
along the selected reference(s), wherease the bottom graph displays the same information scaled to 100% of coverage at that position.<br/>
<br/> 
To select and view results for multiple references simultaneously, check the corresponding checkbox in the Recombination Algorithm 
Parameters section at the top of the page. If more than one reference is selected, the plots for all references will be superimposed 
on the same positional frame.
