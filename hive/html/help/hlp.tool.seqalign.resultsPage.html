<description>This box at the top of the results page summarizes the inputs used to run the alignment.  It contains several fields including:
<span class="pagetext">Request ID</span> – a unique numerical identifier which can be used to retrieve the results locally for a limited time following the analysis
<span class="pagetext">Status</span> – will display “Running” while the alignment is in progress, “Done” when the analysis is complete or “Failed” if the analysis is unable to finish
<span class="pagetext">Time elapsed</span> – displays the amount of time elapsed during the alignment
<span class="pagetext">Percentage complete</span> – displays the percent of the alignment completed
<span class="pagetext">Reference genome</span> – displays the name of the reference genome selected by the user
<span class="pagetext">Sequencing run</span> – displays the name of the query sequence selected or input by the user
<span class="pagetext">Alignment program</span> – displays “seqalign”
<span class="pagetext">Mismatches</span> – displays the maximum percent of mismatches allowed as specified by the user in the <span class="pagetext">Basic Algorithm Parameters</span> section of the input page
<span class="pagetext">Minimum length</span> – displays the minimum length of alignments allowed as specified by the user in the <span class="pagetext">Basic Algorithm Parameters</span> section of the input page
<span class="pagetext">Matches accumulated</span> – displays the option corresponding to the user’s selection in the <a href="hlp.algo.seqalign.multipleMatches.html">Multiple matches</a> parameter in the <span class="pagetext">Basic Algorithm Parameters</span> section of the input page </description>
