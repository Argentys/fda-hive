<description><span class="pagetext">BLAST</span>, or Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, is an alignment algorithm used to compare a query sequence with a reference sequence (or library of sequences) and identify those reads which share identity with the reference.  BLAST does not compare the sequences in entirety, but instead locates short matches (seeds) between the two.  After all short matches between the query sequence and reference sequence are identified a scoring-matrix is used to assign a value to extensions of the short alignments.  Resultant alignments with scores greater than the specified threshold are returned as results.</description>
