<definition>Advanced system parameters for managing and storing computation information</definition>
<description>
At this time, the parameters here are non-modifiable as information is directly captured by the HIVE system and stored according default settings. In the future, the user will be able
to modify these settings using the following options:<br/>
<br/>
<span class='heading'>System Parameters</span>:
<ul style="padding-left:4%">
<li><span class='pn'>Comments</span> - This free text field is intended for information about the submitted computation which is not collected through any other field.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>System</span></li>
<ul><li><span class='pn'>Destination folder</span> - By default, all newly generated computations are directed to the Inbox in your user home directory. However, you may designate
an alternate location from the dropdown menu here.</li>
    <li><span class='pn'>Priority of submission</span> - Default settings facilitate automatic execution of requested processes as soon as possible. Because HIVE is a shared resource, there
    is some modicum of etiquette expected on the user's behalf when queuing and running computations. For example, if you are re-running a computation to meet a deadline, it is perfectly
    acceptable to leave the priority setting as ASAP. If, however, you are instead queuing hundreds of small processes or a few very large options, the "polite submission" and "large submission"
    options allow you to tell the system not to allocate all of its resources to your jobs only. </li>
    <li><span class='pn'>Request action</span> - This field automatically specifies the requested action for a computation as "Run". If there are problems with a computation, a system administrator
    can manually override this status to reflect the necessary changes.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
