<definition>Align a query sequence to a reference genome</definition>
<description>The sequence alignment tool helps the user align the reads from a high throughput experiment to a reference genome.  The reference genome can be selected from the list of provided genomes.  Various parameters are provided to customize the alignment based on user’s needs.  The tool produces a <a href="hlp.view.table.hits.html">hits table</a> and <a href="hlp.view.pie.hits.html">pie chart showing hits</a> which can both be <del><a href="hlp.obj.download.html">downloaded</a></del>.  Additional analysis can be performed to compute <del><a href="hlp.algo.seqalign.snpProfiling.html">SNP profiles</a></del> and <a href="hlp.algo.seqalign.recombinantAnalysis.html">recombinant analysis</a>.  The results of these analyses can also be <del><a href="hlp.obj.download.html">downloaded</a></del> in excel format, viewed in the table query engine or viewed as a variety of available graphs.</description>
