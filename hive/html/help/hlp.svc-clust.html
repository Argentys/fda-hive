<title>HIVE-Octagon</title>
<definition>Sequence hierarchical clustering</definition>
<description>
<span class='toolname'>HIVE-Octagon</span> allows the user to perform 
comparative analysis of multiple variant calling (profiling) results. 
The user has the ability to visualize the hierarchical relationship 
between SNP frequences in different samples in the form of a downloadable 
phylogram or NEWICK raw data file.
<br/><br/>
Parameters may be modified to customize hierarchical clustering 
of sequences of SNP frequencies for alignment profiling results.
<br/><br/><br/>
<span class='heading'>Advanced Parameters</span>:
<ul style="padding-left:4%">
<dl>
    <dt><strong>Distance function parameters</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <ul>
            <li><em>p</em>&nbsp;&mdash; value of <em>p</em> for the <em>p</em>-norm
                distance function</li>
            <li><em>Pearson squared</em>&nbsp;&mdash; whether to use the
                squared variant for the Pearson similarity, i.e. <img
                src="img-algo/pearson-squared.png" style="vertical-align: middle;" /></li>
            <li><em>Pearson uncentered</em>&nbsp;&mdash; whether to use the
                uncentered variant for the Pearson similarity, i.e. <img
                src="img-algo/pearson-uncentered.png"
                style="vertical-align: middle;" /></li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Noise filtering for unfiltered profiling data</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>This option allows noise filtering to be applied to any
            profiling results that were generated without filtering, e.g. in
            order to compare a collection of profiling results among which some were
            generated with noise filtering and some were not.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Automatically filter 95% noise</em>&nbsp;&mdash; data
                from those profiles that had not already had noise filtering done
                when they had been generated will pass through an automatic noise
                filtering stage.</li>
            <li><em>Do not filter noise</em>&nbsp;&mdash; no additional
                noise filtering will be done; this may lead to flawed comparison
                between profiles that already had filtering done when they had been
                generated and those that had not.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>References with incomplete profiling data</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>This option controls what happens if some alignment profiling
            results have data against a reference and others do not.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Treat missing data as SNP-free</em>&nbsp;&mdash;
                profiling results which do not have data for the reference will be
                treated as if the data existed and was identical to the reference
                genome, i.e. SNP-free.</li>
            <li><em>Skip in calculation</em>&nbsp;&mdash; alignment
                profiling results against a reference will be skipped unless <em>all</em>
                of the selected profiling results have data against that reference.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Minimum coverage</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>SNP data for positions with coverage below the specified
            minimum will be ignored (assumed to be 0). This option can be useful
            for experimenting with the effect of higher required coverage on
            hierarchical clustering without needing to recompute profiling each
            time.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>SNP frequency range to consider</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            <em>Except</em> for positions satisfying one of the conditions below,
            SNP frequencies outside the specified range will be ignored (assumed
            to be 0). This option can be useful for focusing the clustering
            algorithm on a specific type of mutation.
        </p>
        <ul><li><em>All profiles as long as one profile meets constraint</em></dt>
            <p>    For any genomic position, if SNP frequency data from at least one
                profile at that position satisfied the frequency range constraint,
                then the SNP frequency data from all other profiles at that
                position <strong>will</strong> be considered (i.e. will <strong>not</strong>
                be assumed to be 0). This exception is enabled by default.
                </p></li>
            <li><em>Position range +/- around position that meets constraint</em>
            <p>
                For any genomic position, if SNP frequency data from at least one
                profile at that position satisfied the frequency range constraint,
                then the SNP frequency that from all profiles for positions within
                a given range of that position <strong>will</strong> be considered
                (i.e. will <strong>not</strong> be assumed to be 0). This exception
                can be set only if the "All profiles..." exception above is
                enabled.
                </p></li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>Save generated shrunk sequences</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Setting this parameter to "yes" will generate and save a fasta
            file containing the sequences filtered according to the Advanced
            Parameters for SNP frequency range to consider.</p>
