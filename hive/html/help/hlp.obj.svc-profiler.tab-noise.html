<description>
The graph in this tab shows the distribution of specific nucleotide variations (A-C, A-T, etc.) with respect to their frequencies.
There is significantly higher abundance of variants with lower frequency. The corresponding table below reports the threshold
frequency associated with various percentage intervals above which variation is deemed significant for each of the twelve
specific nucleotide variations.
