<definition>Preset parameters for HIVE-hexagon alignment of viral sequences</definition>
<description> This page is prepopulated with parameters that are optimized for alignment of virus-derived sequences. The purpose of this page is to enable
users to obtain the best results of computed virus alignments. Viral genomes can be highly divergent and are much smaller than eukaryotic genomes. Viruses also
tend to have a great complexity of genomes with frequent overlapping of coding regions. The parameters found here are suggested to best address these issues.

For basic help using the HIVE-hexagon aligner, see the topic titled <img border="0" src="img/help.gif" width="12"/> <a href="hlp.svc-align-hexagon.html">HIVE-hexagon</a>.
Advanced parameters and help can be found by clicking on the <img border="0" src="img/windown.gif" width="12"/> icon found at the top left of the input box.
