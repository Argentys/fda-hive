<description> This table summarizes the frequency of each specific nucleotide variation (A-C, A-T, etc.) with respect to
the number of occurences (count) of the specific variation. The table below reports the threshold frequency associated
with various percentage intervals above which variation is deemed significant for each of the twelve specific nucleotide
variations.
