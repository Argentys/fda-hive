<title>Gaps and Contigs</title>
<definition>View position and coverage of reported gaps and contigs</definition>
<description>This table displays information about all reported gaps and contigs as computed based on coverage and input parameters for the SNP profiler tool. Columns are as follows:<br/>
<ul/>
<li><span class='pn'>#</span> is an arbitrary number assigned to regions in consecutive order.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>Start</span> is the starting position on the reference genome to which the gap or contig maps.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>End</span> is the end position of the gap/contig with respect to the reference genome position.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>Length</span> is the length of the corresponding gap or contig.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>Average Coverage</span> sums the depth of coverage across all nucleotides in the region and divides this quantity by the total length.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>Has Coverage</span> tells whether the corresponding region has any coverage (true) or not (false).</li>
</ul>
