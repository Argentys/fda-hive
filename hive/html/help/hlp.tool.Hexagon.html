<title>Sequence Alignment on Genome - General Help</title>
<definition>Align a query sequence to a reference genome</definition>
<description>The sequence alignment tool helps the user align the reads from a high throughput experiment to a reference genome.  The reference genome can be selected from the list of provided genomes.  Various parameters are provided to customize the alignment based on user's needs.  The tool produces a <a href="hlp.view.table.hits.html">hits table</a> and <a href="hlp.view.pie.hits.html">pie chart showing hits</a> which can both be <a href="hlp.algo.hexagon.download.alignmentResults.html">downloaded</a>.  Additional analysis can be performed to compute <a href="hlp.algo.seqalign.snpProfiling.html">SNP profiles</a>, the results of which can also be downloaded in .csv format, viewed in the table query engine or viewed as a variety of available graphs.</description>
