<title>SNP profiling</title>
<definition>Compute an SNP profile for the selected gene</definition>
<description> The SNP profile calculates the frequency of individual bases plotted against either the number of bases in the reference genome (the index) or the number of bases in the consensus sequence.  The user must either select a gene (or genes) from the table or click one of the buttons below the <a href="hlp.algo.seqalign.snpProfiling.commands.html">commands</a> tab to specify which genes are analyzed.
A pop-up will notify the user when the computation of the SNP profile has been completed.  Click <span class="pagetext">OK</span> to view the results.
There will now be new tabs available beneath the SNP profiling window, in addition to a new <span class="pagetext">Recombinant analysis</span> section below the <span class="pagetext">Profile analysis</span> section. </description>
