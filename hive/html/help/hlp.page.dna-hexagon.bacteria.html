<definition>Preset parameters for HIVE-hexagon alignment of bacterial sequences</definition>
<description> Bacterial genomes are generally smaller than eukaryotic genomes, consisting of a single DNA molecule and thus making bacterial
genomes haploid.This page is prepopulated with parameter values optomized for bacterial genome alignment.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the main HIVE-hexagon parameters (see the topic titled <img border="0" src="img/help.gif" width="12"/> <a href="hlp.svc-align-hexagon.html">HIVE-hexagon</a> for help with
basic HIVE-hexagon functions), the bacterial page has the following specially called out parameter designed specifically to address common properties of bacterial genomes: <br/>
<br/>
Repeat and Transposition discovery - Tell the alignment engine to perform more detailed multi-pass lookups in order to identify repeats and transpositions at the expense of a longer run-time.<br/>
