    <dt>Alignment profiling results to compare</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>A list of alignment profiling results. These must all be generated from alignments against the same reference genome (but possibly against different references within that reference genome). The sequences of SNP frequencies from the selected alignment results serve as the main input to the hierarchical clustering algorithm.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Reference genome</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>A genomic sequence; all of the chosen alignment profiling results must be generated from alignments against this sequence.</p>
    </dd>
