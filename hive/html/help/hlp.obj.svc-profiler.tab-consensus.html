<title>Consensus</title>
<definition>View the consensus generated by base-calling of a sample against a reference</definition>
<description>This tab shows the consensus sequence of reads covering the region of the selected reference segment.
The consensus sequence calls the base with highest frequency of occurrence across all reads. The consensus can be
generated by treatment of gaps in one of four ways:<br/>
<ul>
<li><span class='pn'>displayed</span> - Gaps will be maintained and displayed as + at the position. </li>
<li><span class='pn'>filled</span> - Gap positions will be filled with the reference nucleotide. </li>
<li><span class='pn'>skipped</span> - Gap positions will be excised and flanking regions will be concatenated.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>split</span> - Gap positions will be excised and flanking regions will be maintained as separate sequences.</li>
</ul>
Please note - sequences over a certain length will not appear in their entirety in the window. For these extra long sequences,
 the user will need to use the horizontal scroll bar to view the whole sequence.
