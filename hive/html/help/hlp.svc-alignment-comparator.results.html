<definition>How to interpret results of the Alignment Comparator</definition>
<description>
The Alignment Comparator supplies many different tables and graphics, as described below.<br/>
<br/>
<span class='heading'>Results</span>:
<ul style="padding-left:4%">
<dl>
    <dt><span class='pn'>Reference Mapping Table</span></dt>
        <dd>View alignment details by reference in tabular format
        </dd>
<br/>
    <dt><span class='pn'>Hits</span></dt>
        <dd>View the number of hits for each alignment with reference IDs as row headers and 
            alignment object IDs as column headers            
        </dd>
<br/>
    <dt><span class='pn'>RPKM</span></dt>
        <dd>View the RPKMs for each alignment with reference IDs as row headers and 
            alignment object IDs as column headers
        </dd>
<br/>
    <dt><span class='pn'>Combination Mapping Table</span></dt>
        <dd>View alignment details by combinations of hit references in tabular format
        </dd>
<br/>
    <dt><span class='pn'>Heatmap</span></dt>
        <dd>View results as a heatmap of hits to references for each sample            
        </dd>
<br/>
    <dt><span class='pn'>Parallel Coordinates</span></dt>
        <dd>Allows generating colored coordinate schemes of the reference or combination 
            mapping tables, depending on the selection
        </dd>  
<br/>
    <dt><span class='pn'>Venn Diagram</span></dt>
        <dd>View a Venn diagram of the hits or RPKMs (based on user selection) for each reference 
            and the overlap between such hits across samples
        </dd>
<br/>
    <dt><span class='pn'>Chord Diagram</span></dt>
        <dd>View a chord diagram of the results such that each vertical category represents a distinct sample 
            and lines between two samples indicates overlap of references hit by the linked samples            
        </dd>
<br/>
    <dt><span class='pn'>Available Files to Download</span></dt>
        <dd>By default, the Hits and RPKM tables are available for download as .csv files, but many of the 
            graphics can also be downloaded in .svg format
        </dd>
