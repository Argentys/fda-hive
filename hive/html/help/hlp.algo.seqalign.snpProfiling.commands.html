<title>SNP profiling – commands tab</title>
<definition>Specify inputs to customize your SNP profile</definition>
<description>

This tab contains several inputs which allow the user to customize the SNP profile to suit individual preferences.  Options include: <br/>
<ul>
    <li><span class="pagetext">build profile relative to</span> - the user may specify to profile relative to the reference genome or the consensus sequence</li>
    <li><span class="pagetext">minimal alignment length in percent of original query length accepted for profiling</span> - the user must enter a number that corresponds to the minimal percent of alignment length/query length, default set to 0%</li>
    <li><span class="pagetext">overall quality filter of mapped sequences in percent of original query length</span> - user must provide a number that corresponds to a percent of the original query length, default set to 0</li>
    <li><span class="pagetext">automatic adjustment limit for base-calls with forward/reverse expression unbalance</span> - user must provide a number that corresponds to the minimum percentage of difference in forward and reverse base-calls such that positions with unbalance exceeding that percentage will not be excluded from analysis, default set to 5</li>
    <li><span class="pagetext">minimal alignment coverage for a base-call</span> - user must provide a number to specify the minimum coverage of alignments such that any position with coverage less than the specified number will be excluded from the profiling, default set to 30</li>
    <li><span class="pagetext">base-call positional entropic computation</span> - user may specify whether to disable or enable positional entropic computation by selecting the appropriate option from the dropdown menu, default set to "disabled" </li>
</ul>
