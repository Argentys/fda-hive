<definition>View alignments to reference genes as different colored wedges</definition>
<description>The hits (alignments) of the query sequence(s) to each individual gene of the reference genome (or segment of a reference set) are shown here as differently colored wedges.
 Percent values indicate the fraction of query sequences aligned to each specific gene. Holding the mouse over a section will display gene identifiers, number of hits and percent of
 hits to the specific gene.
