The Data Preview box on the user home screen displays preview information corresponding to an object selected from the user home directory. For all objects, a metadata
details tab displays information relevant to the object. All computational, data-loading or other processing objects will also have a
progress tab where the user can track ongoing progress of all processing threads or view details of progress when execution is complete. Some
object types have additional unique previews specific to that type of object. When an object is selected, this help box will automatically load the text relevant to the selected
object type.
