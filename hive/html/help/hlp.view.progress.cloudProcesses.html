<definition>Progress and completion stats of all steps of process</definition>
<description>This tab shows a summary of statistics associated with the progress and completion of all steps required to fulfill a user-initiated process request. Results are listed in a hierarchy such that the each sub-process is a child of the entire process. Current status, time elapsed and percent completion is listed for all processes and subprocesses. Hovering over a process will display a box containing the specific HIVE-assigned request ID of the subprocess. Every hierarchical node is collapsible.</description>
