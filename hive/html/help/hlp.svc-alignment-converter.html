<description>
<span class='toolname'>DNA Alignment Converter</span> is a tool that converts SAM files into a HIVE alignment computation for ease of use in downstream processing using HIVE tools. DNA Alignment Converter uses the SAM file and reference genome(s) used to generate the SAM file as inputs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class='heading'>Basic inputs and parameters</span>:
<ul style="padding-left:4%">
<li><span class='pn'>Name</span> - In this field, you can designate a name for the generated HIVE alignment computation for simple search and retrieval from your user home directory.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>Source SAM file</span> - Select the SAM file you are interested in convertnig into a HIVE alignment computation format.</li>
<li><span class='pn'>Reference Genome</span> - Select the genome(s) that were used in the alignment to produce the SAM file you are converting. Multiple reference genomes can be selected in the file explorer by holding Ctrl and clicking each reference.
</ul>
