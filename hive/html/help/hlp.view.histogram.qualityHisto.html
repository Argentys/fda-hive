<title>Query Sequence quality-histogram</title>
<definition>View a histogram showing the average quality score as a function of sequence position</definition>
<description>This tab is only present when an individual sequence (with green check mark icon) is selected from the <span class="pagetext">Query Sequences (reads)</span> menu.  Clicking this tab displays a histogram with sequence position on the X axis and the quality of the corresponding position on the Y axis.  All quality values are reported as <a href="hlp.obj.phred.html">Phred scores</a>.  When the user hovers over each position, a small pop-up window displays the exact quality of the selected position.</description>
