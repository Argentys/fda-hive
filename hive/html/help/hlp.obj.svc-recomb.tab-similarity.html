<title>Similarity of samples to reference</title>
<definition>Compare counts of the sample alignments to different reference sequences</definition>
<description>This is the default view of the recombination discovery tool, showing the similarity by position
 of the samples and the various references. Similarity is represented in the top graph as a function of absolute
 counts of alignments to each reference and in the bottom as a proportion of alignments to each reference.
