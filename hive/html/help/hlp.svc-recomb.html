<title>Reference recombination discovery</title> 
<definition>Identify regions of recombination between closely related references</definition>
<description>
The <span class='toolname'>Reference recombination</span> engine enables concurrent visualization of a single sample aligned 
to multiple reference segments. By comparing the distribution of sample coverage across different genomes and cross-referencing 
this coverage to a multiple-alignment of the reference segment, the user can clearly view variable regions of coverage distribution 
across references, which may imply a recombination event. This tool was specifically designed to facilitate discovery of recombination 
among closely related viral and bacterial populations. <br/>

<span class='heading'>Selecting Input Data:</span>
<ul style="padding-left:4%">
The default input page for the Recombinator is identical to the <a href="hlp.obj.svc-align-hexagon.info.html">alignment 
results</a> output view, with an augmented hit <img src="img/list.gif" width=15> <a href="hlp.obj.svc-align-hexagon.tab-list.html">list</a> 
to enable check box selection of the references to be profiled. References can be selected individually by selecting the checkbox 
adjacent to the reference of interest or as a complete set by clicking the checkbox in the top left column of the default list 
alignment results table.
</ul>
<br/>
<span class='heading'>Basic Inputs and Parameters</span>
<ul style=padding-left:4%>
<dl>
    <dt><span class='pn'>Name</span></dt> 
    <dd>Provide a unique name to the recombination process for easy search and retrieval of results. A default name will be provided 
    if nothing is specified</dd>
    <br/>
    <dt><span class='pn'>Reference Genome Alignment File</span></dt>
    <dd>By default, the alignment from which the recombination page was accessed will populate this field. Clicking the dropdown menu 
    will open your user home directory from which you can select alternative  alignments as inputs. Alignments can be removed from 
    inputs by selecting the corresponding row and clicking the red <img src="img/recDelete.gif" width=15> icon to the right.</dd>
