<description>

In order to register, you will need to enter some basic information and select your group of membership.<br/>
<br/>
NAME AND EMAIL:<br/>
All email addresses and names should be entered as they appear in FDA human resource records. Only FDA email addresses can be used for registration to ensure the security and appropriate authorization for your account.<br/>
<br/>
PASSWORDS:<br/>
Passwords must include one lower case letter, one upper case letter and one number, and must be a minimum length of 8 characters.<br/>
<br/>
GROUP MEMBERSHIP:<br/>
Select your department within the FDA hierarchy by clicking the adjacent checkbox. To expand any node in the hierarchy, click on the <img border="0" width="12" height="12" src="img/recExpand.gif"> Please do not register for a certain group unless you are sure it is correct. All group membership assignments are subject to verification and therefore you may only register under the appropriate group. If you are unsure, contact your supervisor, or please feel free to contact a HIVE administrator for further assistance.<br/>
<br/>
Once all fields have been populated and selections made, click the "Save" button directly below the password field. This will send your request for creation of your account to a HIVE administrator. At this time, you should receive an email containing a confirmation link at your supplied FDA address. Follow the link to verify your identity. You must now wait for a HIVE administrator to activate your account. You will receive a second email when this process is complete, at which time you will have full access to HIVE operations as specified by your group's settings.
