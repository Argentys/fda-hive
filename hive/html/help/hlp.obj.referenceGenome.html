<description>A reference genome is a comprehensive sequence of the entire genome of a given species, assembled by scientists to be representative of that species. Reference genomes can be selected from the table by selecting one or many checkboxes to the left of the associated genome sequnces. After each click the box will close. You may select multiple by either reopening the box and selecting another, or by holding the control key while checking multiple boxes.<br></br>

Once reference genome(s) are selected, you will see the names of each genome and the number of corresponding records for each in the Reference Genomes input box.<br></br>

You may alternately create one hybrid reference sequence from multiple genomes by clicking the <img border="0" src="img/hiveseq.gif" width="12"/> icon, which will redirect you to a new page. On this page, select your desired sequences to concatenate, click the <img border="0" src="img/plus.gif" width="12"/> icon to add the sequences the composition space below. Enter a name in the 'new hiveseq name' field and click the <img border="0" src="img/hiveseq-save.gif" width="12"/> icon to save the new sequence. The new sequence will be available iny your reference genomes list after the page is refreshed.<br></br>
