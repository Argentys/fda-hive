<title>Query Sequence base-quality bar chart</title>
<definition>View the average quality for each base in the query sequence as a bar chart</definition>
<description>This tab is only present when an individual sequence (with green check mark icon) is selected from the <span class="pagetext">Query Sequences (reads)</span> menu.  Clicking on this tab displays a bar graph with a bar for each nucleotide on the X axis and the average quality score of the corresponding nucleotide on the Y axis.  All quality values are reported as <a href="hlp.obj.phred.html">Phred scores</a>.  When the user hovers over a bar, a small pop-up window shows the exact average quality score of the selected nucleotide.</description>
