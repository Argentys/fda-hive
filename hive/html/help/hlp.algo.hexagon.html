<description><span class="pagetext">Hexagon</span> is an alignment algorithm, similar to <a href="hlp.algo.blast.html">NCBI BLAST</a>, that finds short alignments by seeding and subsequent extension.  The hexagon algorithm runs faster than BLAST and therefore is able to use a smaller seed size, increasing sensitivity.</description>
