<title>Viral Mutation Comparator</title>
<definition>Compare, view, and filter mutation calls from several sources </definition>
<description>Mutations reported across several sources can be analyzed, unified and reformatted into a single, easy to read table
for further filtration using HIVE's table query capabilities. This allows users to compare previously generated, external mutation
calls for viral samples to mutations discovered using HIVE's internal variant calling pipeline. Users may choose to report all
mutations across input sources, or choose only to report those which are present in more than one source. A number of follow-up
analyses can be performed to mine the newly comprehensive tables for across-sample trends or statistics. For example, the following
table provides a sample of results in which all substitutions occurring at a specific position are reported by position, along with
the number of subjects containing a mutation at that position, and the relative ratios of the various mutations at the position. <br/>

This is just one of many types of analysis that can be achieved by this powerful tool. <br/>
