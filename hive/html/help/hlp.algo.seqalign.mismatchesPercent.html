<title>Mismatches %</title>
<definition>Remove alignments with mismatch % greater than specified value</definition>
<description>A mismatch in an alignment occurs when the query and reference align at most points but have different nucleotides at one position in the same region.  An alignment is not disregarded due to mismatches, but the alignment score reflects a penalty associated with mismatches.  The mismatch percentage is equal to the total number of mismatches divided by the total number of positions.
<span class="equations">Mismatch % = total # mismatches/total # positions</span>
This filter will remove alignments with a mismatch % greater than the specified value.</description>
