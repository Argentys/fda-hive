<title>Alignment extension</title>
<definition>Specify the mode of alignment extension</definition>
<description>This option allows the user to specify how the alignment will be extended.  The <span class=”pagetext”>Extended</span> option continues aligning the sequences until it reaches the threshold of mismatches encountered, resulting in lower sensitivity but higher coverage.  The <span class=”pagetext”>Compact</span> option terminates the alignment as soon as a higher score is obtained, providing higher sensitivity but lower coverage.  The compact mode is a good choice when working with small genomes that have a higher mutation rate.</description>
