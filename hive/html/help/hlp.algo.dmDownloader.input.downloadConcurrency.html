<title>Download concurrency option</title>
<definition>Specify how many files should be loaded to the system at the same time</definition>
<description>This option allows the user to specify whether to load one or several files to the system at the same time.  <span class="pagetext">Low</span> specifies to download jobs individually.  <span class="pagetext">High</span> tells the downloader to do several jobs concurrently.  PLEASE NOTE: if the user has several redundant items in the list, the high option will collapse the system.  Furthermore, if the downloaded file is big, the user should not submit the same request before the previous request has been completed, otherwise it will collapse the system.</description>
