<ul>
<li><em>Unaligned Reads</em>: number of reads that successfully aligned, classified by <em>read length</em></li>
<li><em>Aligned Reads</em>: number of reads that failed to align, also classified by their <em>read length</em></li>
<li><em>Alignments</em>: number of those parts of reads which successfully aligned, classified by the <em>length of the part that aligned</em>&nbsp;&mdash; which may be smaller than the length of the whole read.</li>
</ul>
If the distribution of Alignments and Aligned Reads differ, this typically indicates a QA problem.
