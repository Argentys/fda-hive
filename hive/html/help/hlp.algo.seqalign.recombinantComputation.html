<title>Recombinant analysis – Recombinant computation</title>
<definition>View recombination events between two selected reference genes</definition>
<description> This section allows the user to look at recombination events between any two genes listed in the reference genome list to the left.  Parameters include:
<span class="pagetext">paired run?</span> – the user specifies whether or not the reads are from a paired run experiment
<span class="pagetext">minimal length of non-overlap on both sides</span> – the user may accept the default or provide a number specifying the minimum length of non-overlapping sequences flanking the overlapping regions such that any overlapping sequences with flanking non-overlap shorter than this value will be excluded
<span class="pagetext">maximum overlap on the read frame</span> – the user may accept the default or provide a number specifying the maximum length of overlapping sequences from the selected genes such that any overlapping regions longer than this value will be excluded
After analysis is complete, more tabs (<a href="hlp.view.chart.overlaps.html">overlaps</a> and <a href="hlp.algo.recombinantComputation.download.html">download</a>) will be available.</description>
