<definition>Define parameters and inputs for SNP profile</definition>
<description>The SNP profile calculates the frequency of individual bases plotted against either the number of bases in the reference genome (the index) or the number of bases in the consensus sequence. The default input page for the SNP profiler tool is identical to the <a href="hlp.view.results.alignment.html">alignment results</a> output summary. To select a reference genome for SNP profile, you must check the corresponding check box in the <a href="hlp.view.table.hits.html">hit list</a>. Once this is done, some algorithm parameter fields will populate. Parameters have descriptions accessible by hovering mouse over topic, further information is provided for selected parameters below:<br></br>
<br></br>
Forward/Revers Unbalance - User must provide a number that corresponds to the minimum percentage of difference in forward and reverse base-calls such that positions with unbalance exceeding that percentage will not be excluded from analysis, default set to 0<br></br>
Number of Computational Subjects per Single Thread - Specify the maximum size of each computationally parallelized "chunk"<br></br>
Truncate Terminals - Specify a number of base-pairs to cut from each end of the alignments before computing profile<br></br>

Click the Analyze button to proceed with the profiling.
