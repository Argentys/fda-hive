<title>Recombinant computation – overlaps tab</title>
<definition>View overlapping regions of selected reference genes</definition>
<description>The default view shows a graph of any overlapping regions of the two selected reference genes.  Each gene is designated by the same color used in the <span class="pagetext">pairs</span> tab to the left.
Between the graphs and the tabs is a list of viewing options, allowing the user to view or hide the top-profile, overlaps or bottom profile.  The top profile is a graph of the counts as a function of position for the first selected gene.  Similarly, the bottom profile is a graph of the counts as a function of position for the second selected gene.  The the <span class="pagetext">x</span> icon will hide a particular graph while clicking the the <span class="pagetext">+</span> icon will show a hidden graph.  </description>
